# Automated-Call-In-Service
This is a program created in Python that simulates an automated call-in service. It is a prototype designed for agricultural workers to learn about their labour rights. It is a very simple application, however it is the first time I used audio playback in Python.

To run the code, simply launch it in terminal (it has no command-line arguments).
